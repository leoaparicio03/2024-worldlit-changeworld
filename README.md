### Progressive Era Issue - Meat Inspection Act

- Upton Sinclair was a journal investigating the meat industry and what they put in our foods. Soon he exposed them, and the Pure Food and Drug act was created.
There were many ways during the progressive era to protest and I will list some.
- A muckraker named Upton Sinclair made a book called the jungle and it exposed the secrets of the meat package industry, and this was one of the biggest protest methods in the progressive era. 
- Even the government got involved and they passed the Pure Food and Drug Act, which forced all companies to put what the ingredients of products on the labels.
- A man named Harvey Washington Wiley, lead the Pure Food and Drug Act. He pushed the food bill in 1906. Before that he was the Chief Chemist of the U.S and would inspect foods for chemicals.

##### What was wrong with the meat package industry before?

- The working conditions were horrible.
- Rats would often be mixed in the sausage meat.
- Machines would work on vats that leaked lard.
##### How much did the jungle affect the industry?

- After the Jungle was released, the meat inspection act was passed and soon lead to the Pure Food and Drug act, which required for products to have label of the ingredients.
- The government had inspected these meat companies.
##### Did the industry hurt anyone?  
- Yes, the industry had horrible conditions for the workers.
- Since rat meat was mixed in the food, it spread illnesses and caused many people to be sick.

### Current Era Issue - Poaching
I think poaching should be even more strict and its not fair for animals to be hunted down due to their horns, tusks, blood, etc.
- For example, pangolins are in danger of extinction and many locals say that the problem stems from unchecked poaching.
- Because Rhino horns are valuable, so many poachers are hunting rhino that some rhino species are extinct.

The intent of this website is to bring awareness to the problem of poaching. I will try my hardest to bring awareness and maybe nothing will change, but its best if I try.

##### What is poaching?

- Poaching is the illegal hunting of animals for their horns, tusks, blubber, blood, etc.â€¦
##### Why is poaching an issue?

- White rhinos are nearly extinct due to poachers. Poachers hunt white rhinos for their horns.
- Now there are about, 10,000 white rhinos left in the world, and they are estimated to be extinct soon.
##### How can I solve poaching?  
- For now, the best to do is to create more preservations and have armed security to guard these preservations.
- Another solution is to make laws that are enforce like, if poaching is conducted, then they will serve a 40-year sentence and have all their money and status taken from them to give to the poor. This will cause a sense of dread and mentally break the poachers.
- I could also write a book about poaching and the effect it has on the ecosystem.
